# Contributing

All code in this repository is part of an University assignment, so I will not accept any pull requests or
any other junks of code from anyone but my team members. <br>
What I do appreciate greatly, however, are tips and feedback - I'm still a student and thus
prone to make mistakes. If there's anything you think I could do better, or found a bug, or 
 just have a suggestion, feel free to drop me an issue and I'll look into it when I have the time.

That being said, thanks for stopping by and have a nice day! :sparkles:
