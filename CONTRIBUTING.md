# Contributing

All code in this repository is part of an University assignment, so I will not accept any pull requests or
any other junks of code from anyone but my team members. <br>
What I do appreciate greatly, however, are tips and feedback - I'm still a student and thus
prone to make mistakes. If there's anything you think I could do better, or found a bug, or 
 just have a suggestion, feel free to drop me an issue and I'll look into it when I have the time.

That being said, thanks for stopping by and have a nice day! :sparkles:


## Contributing Guidelines
- I appreciate issues!
- I love funny commit messages for minor fixes, but please provide helpful messages for major changes.
- Remember the branch structure! Don't push wonky stuff on master. :wink:
- Keep your libraries up-to-date ~ live in the danger zone ^_^
    - I love being up-to-date with the latest and greatest releases. This project has been developed 
     with PHP 7.* and Bootstrap 4-alpha in mind.
    Please familiarize yourself with their respective changelogs if you have not yet done so.
- Keep vendor libraries out of the repo whenever possible! Let Composer handle that for you locally.
- Please keep in mind to adhere to the standards [PSR 4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) 
and [PSR 7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).
- Please **write clean code**. That includes (but is not limited to...)
    - dependency injection and inversion of control
    - S.O.L.I.D. principles
    - security basics (I'm looking at you, SQL injection!)
        - On that note, remember not to push sensible data.
    
Also, make sure you have a grip on the basics from this page:
