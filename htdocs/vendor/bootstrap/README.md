### What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```
bootstrap/
├── css/
│   ├── bootstrap.css
│   ├── bootstrap.css.map
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css
│   └── bootstrap.min.css.map
└── js/
    ├── bootstrap.js
    └── bootstrap.min.js
```

We provide compiled CSS and JS (`bootstrap.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`bootstrap.min.*`). CSS [source maps](../../../../htdocs/index.php) (`bootstrap.*.map`) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools.


## Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request? Please first read the [issue guidelines](../../../../htdocs/index.php#using-the-issue-tracker) and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](../../../../htdocs/index.php).


## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](../../../../htdocs/index.php) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://getbootstrap.com>. The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. Run through the [tooling setup](../../../../htdocs/index.php#tooling-setup) to install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.
2. Run `grunt` (or a specific set of Grunt tasks) to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.
3. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the command line.
4. Open <http://localhost:9001> in your browser, and voilà.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

### Documentation for previous releases

Documentation for v2.3.2 has been made available for the time being at <https://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/> while folks transition to Bootstrap 3.

[Previous releases](../../../../htdocs/index.php) and their documentation are also available for download.



## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](../../../../htdocs/index.php). Included are directions for opening issues, coding standards, and notes on development.

Moreover, if your pull request contains JavaScript patches or features, you must include [relevant unit tests](../../../../htdocs/index.php). All HTML and CSS should conform to the [Code Guide](../../../../htdocs/index.php), maintained by [Mark Otto](../../../../htdocs/index.php).

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See [the Releases section of our GitHub project](../../../../htdocs/index.php) for changelogs for each release version of Bootstrap. Release announcement posts on [the official Bootstrap blog](../../../../htdocs/index.php) contain summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release.
